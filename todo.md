- have the first main page's panel be on each page; change first
navbar tab to "Personal Projects"

will view the webpage (that is, assume other people may stumble
across it; good for personal branding)
- some means of providing more information on a project if desired,
since an average viewer may not be able to tell what each project does

	with more details about the project
	- ideas to make project preview panels more interesting
		- regarding showing more images
			- have gallery of three/four images at bottom of each panel
			- clicking an image generates a popup showing a carousel
			of images
