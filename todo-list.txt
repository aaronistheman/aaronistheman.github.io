List of Other, Non-Extraneous Tasks (in no particular order)
--------------------------------------

-education page
	-mention
		-current college, degree, etc. (see resume for good ideas)
-etc. (other pages)


Eventually (relatively extraneous tasks)
-----------------------------

-somewhere on the webpage, mention that no personal website-frameworks
were used. Just Bootstrap, Angular, etc.
-improve navigation bar
	-make it look better? (it's too wide)
	-make a link (not the brand name) to the home page; remove the link
	that the brand name has
	-emphasize which navbar link is the current page (this one seems trickier
	than simple Bootstrap)
