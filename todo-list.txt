-Angular
	-see if can include projects.html in home.html and also
	use it as a standalone webpage
		-just use a variable that sets up the projects page
		if its set to true
	-move templates into their own files (see sample
	"MEAN Web Development" code for more on how to do this)
	-figure out how to split app.js up too
-start readme
	-mention the goal of a responsive webpage
-what next?


Eventually
----------

-somewhere on the webpage, mention that no personal website-frameworks
were used. Just Bootstrap, Angular, etc.
-improve navigation bar
	-make it look better? (it's too wide)
	-make a link (not the brand name) to the home page; remove the link
	that the brand name has
	-emphasize which navbar link is the current page (this one seems trickier
	than simple Bootstrap)


Webpage Angular Templates
-------------------------

-home.html
-education.html
-projects.html?
-leadership.html
-work.html
-development-process.html
	-ideas on what to mention:
		-test-driven development
		-Git
		-todo list
		-small shell scripts
