Next (in particular order)
----

-make personal webpage look beautiful and unique,
but still easy on the eye


Finishing Touches
-----------------

-personal webpage image that is a recursive photo of the personal webpage
-have "current" images of my other current projects
-replace the resume link with a real one


Considerable
------------

-erase the assumption that only recruiters who have my resume
will view the webpage (that is, assume other people may stumble
across it; good for personal branding)
-some means of providing more information on a project if desired,
since an average viewer may not be able to tell what each project does
and may be curious about it
	-having each project's panel be a link to a jumbotron/webpage/etc.
	with more details about the project
	-ideas to make project preview panels more interesting
		-have noteworthy fact with some projects
		-have noteworthy regret with some projects? (a "not-so-fun fact")
		-have "biggest challenge" for some/all projects
		-regarding showing more images
			-have gallery of three/four images at bottom of each panel
			-clicking an image generates a popup showing a carousel
			of images
-somewhere on the webpage, mention that no personal website-frameworks
were used. Just Bootstrap, Angular, etc.
-use Google custom fonts
-think of implement-able features that aren't in GitHub/LinkedIn,
such as
	-filtering my projects by language
-perhaps find a screen reader to use for testing personal webpage
-add a navbar link to a page that lets user play/use some of my
web applications (Game Show Fusion, maybe Simplified Economic Model
if I make it more robust); if it's just game(s), can call it "Arcade"
