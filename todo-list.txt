-main page (minus project previews)
	-at first just add the panels contents
		-first panel
			-*picture and name
			-tagline
			-links
		-second panel
			-link to my development process page
	-properly format the panels
	-make proper content (don't just use placeholders to put it off)
	-lingering concerns
		-first subpanel's contents aren't centered
-perhaps find a screen reader to use for testing personal webpage
-projects preview page
	-each project preview should have its own panel
	-mention that a preview can be clicked for more details
	-contents of each project preview
		-have option to view bunch of images of a project
		-tba (see resume for ideas)


List of Other, Non-Extraneous Tasks (in no particular order)
--------------------------------------

-education page
	-mention
		-current college, degree, etc. (see resume for good ideas)
-etc. (other pages)


Eventually (relatively extraneous tasks)
-----------------------------

-get a better picture of myself :-)
-somewhere on the webpage, mention that no personal website-frameworks
were used. Just Bootstrap, Angular, etc.
-improve navigation bar
	-make it look better? (it's too wide)
	-make a link (not the brand name) to the home page; remove the link
	that the brand name has
	-emphasize which navbar link is the current page (this one seems trickier
	than simple Bootstrap)


Webpage Angular Templates
-------------------------

-home.html
-education.html
-projects.html?
-leadership.html
-work.html
-development-process.html
	-ideas on what to mention:
		-test-driven development
		-Git
		-todo list
		-small shell scripts
