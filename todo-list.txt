Next (in particular order)
----



Before Finished (in no particular order)
---------------

-see if there's anything from the "Considerable" section
that I want to implement
-make personal webpage look beautiful and unique,
but still easy on the eye


Finishing Touches
-----------------

-personal webpage image that is a recursive photo of the personal webpage
-have "current" images of my other current projects
-replace the resume link with a real one


Considerable
------------

-erase the assumption that only recruiters who have my resume
will view the webpage (that is, assume other people may stumble
across it; good for personal branding)
-some means of providing more information on a project if desired,
since an average viewer may not be able to tell what each project does
and may be curious about it
-somewhere on the webpage, mention that no personal website-frameworks
were used. Just Bootstrap, Angular, etc.
-use Google custom fonts
-think of implement-able features that aren't in GitHub/LinkedIn,
such as
	-filtering my projects by language
-put tagline back
	-possible pros of tagline:
		-so it's know that I'm a prospective software engineer to
		the average viewer (do I care, though? a recruiter would
		have my resume and know I'm a programmer?)
-perhaps find a screen reader to use for testing personal webpage
-having each project's panel be a link to a jumbotron/webpage/etc.
with more details about the project
-add a navbar link to a page that lets user play/use some of my
web applications (Game Show Fusion, maybe Simplified Economic Model
if I make it more robust); if it's just game(s), can call it "Arcade"
-ideas to make project preview panels more interesting
	-have noteworthy fact with some projects
	-have noteworthy regret with some projects? (a "not-so-fun fact")
	-have "biggest challenge" for some/all projects
	-regarding showing more images
		-have gallery of three/four images at bottom of each panel
		-clicking an image generates a popup showing a carousel
		of images


Webpage Angular Templates
-------------------------

-home.html
-education.html
-projects.html?
-leadership.html
-work.html
-development-process.html
	-ideas on what to mention:
		-test-driven development
		-Git
		-todo list
		-small shell scripts
-page for noteworthy courses taken
