		-a button saying "click to see images"
			-images (x2?)
				-clicking any image will show more images?

					-images could be in form of a carousel
					in some sort of popup

List of Other, Non-Extraneous Tasks (in no particular order)
--------------------------------------

-education page
	-mention
		-current college, degree, etc. (see resume for good ideas)
-lingering concerns
	-on main page, first subpanel's contents aren't centered
-replace the resume link with a real one
-use Google custom fonts
-main page
	-move tagline to its own panel above the first, so links
	have more room
-etc. (other pages)


Relatively extraneous tasks or Thoughts/Possible Ideas
-----------------------------

-think of implement-able features that aren't in GitHub/LinkedIn,
such as
	-filtering my projects my language
	-some means of stressing that I do test-driven development
-put tagline back?
-get a better picture of myself :-)
-somewhere on the webpage, mention that no personal website-frameworks
were used. Just Bootstrap, Angular, etc.
-improve navigation bar
	-make it look better? (it's too wide)
	-make a link (not the brand name) to the home page; remove the link
	that the brand name has
	-emphasize which navbar link is the current page (this one seems trickier
	than simple Bootstrap)
-perhaps find a screen reader to use for testing personal webpage
-having each project's panel be a link to a jumbotron/webpage/etc.
with more details about the project
-add a navbar link to a page that lets user play/use some of my
web applications (Game Show Fusion, maybe Simplified Economic Model
if I make it more robust); if it's just game(s), can call it "Arcade"


Webpage Angular Templates
