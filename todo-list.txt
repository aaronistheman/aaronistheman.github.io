-leadership section
	-update review session info
	-add info on Robotics Programming Head
-main panel
	-removed LinkedIn link? (so I don't have to keep my LinkedIn updated?)
-convert personal webpage into extended resume
-YouTube channel link?


Considerable

-"my development process" page
	-arguments for
		-reveal information that may make me look better
	-arguments against
		-the information isn't so spectacular
	-content
		-source-code control
		-todo list
-have the first main page's panel be on each page; change first
navbar tab to "Personal Projects"
-erase the assumption that only recruiters who have my resume
will view the webpage (that is, assume other people may stumble
across it; good for personal branding)
-some means of providing more information on a project if desired,
since an average viewer may not be able to tell what each project does
and may be curious about it
	-having each project's panel be a link to a jumbotron/webpage/etc.
	with more details about the project
	-ideas to make project preview panels more interesting
		-regarding showing more images
			-have gallery of three/four images at bottom of each panel
			-clicking an image generates a popup showing a carousel
			of images
-somewhere on the webpage, mention that no personal website-frameworks
were used. Just Bootstrap, Angular, etc.
-use Google custom fonts
-think of implement-able features that aren't in GitHub/LinkedIn,
such as
	-filtering my projects by language
-perhaps find a screen reader to use for testing personal webpage
-add a navbar link to a page that lets user play/use some of my
web applications (Game Show Fusion, maybe Simplified Economic Model
if I make it more robust); if it's just game(s), can call it "Arcade"
-use CSS variables somehow (e.g. SASS, LESS)
