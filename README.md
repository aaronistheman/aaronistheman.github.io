# Personal Website (Currently Unfinished)

(Last updated: 12/29/2016)

About
-----

This is Aaron Kaloti's currently unfinished website.
He hopes to have it finished by the end of December.
Ideally without the use of any web design frameworks (though
libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap are fair game).

Through proper use of Bootstrap,
he aims to have the website be responsive to
devices of different sizes.
